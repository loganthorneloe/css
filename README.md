# Logan's CSS

This is a very simple CSS file to create a simple, beautiful, and responsive website. It's easily configurable if you know CSS and HTML, but doesn't need to be adjusted in any way. You can just download it and add it to your project.

You can see this stylesheet in action at https://loganthorneloe.com.

It's currently configures two CSS variables for primary and seconday brand colors. Just add your desired hex code to these fields:
```
:root {
  --primary-color: #eb5757;
  --secondary-color: #8c52ff;
}
```
to change them to your desired color palette.
